This application is built for one purpose only and that's to automate your likes on Instagram. 

## What I mean?

When you open Instalike you will have to type your username and password for Facebook and hashtag by your choice. The application will open Chrome using chromedriver and automatically enter your username and password using Selenium. After scrolling for 17 pages of images it will start liking images with the random interval between 12 and 20 sec to make it look more organic. You can minimize the windows and continue working. After one hour it will close automatically so you don't have to worry about that.
